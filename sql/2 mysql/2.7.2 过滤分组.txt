WHERE 根据数据表中的字段直接进行过滤，而 HAVING 是根据前面已经查询出的字段进行过滤。

1、相同
mysql> SELECT name,sex,height FROM tb_students_info 
    -> HAVING height>150;              //前面必须查询到height才能用HAVING
	
mysql> SELECT name,sex,height FROM tb_students_info 
-> WHERE height>150;


mysql> SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(name),sex,height FROM tb_students_info 
    -> GROUP BY height 
    -> HAVING AVG(height)>170;
